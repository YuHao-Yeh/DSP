SYNOPSIS:

train :
	./train <iteration_number> <model_init_path> <seq_path> <output_model_path>

test :
	./test <models_list_path> <seq_path> <output_result_path>

README

*"data/test_lbl.txt" records the correct answers to "test_seq.txt" from model 01 ~ 05, which are trained by given "test_seq_01~05.txt" files.

========================
HOW TO COMPILE:

To compile the demo, simply follow the following steps
	make

========================
HOW TO RUN:

	./train <iteration_number> <model_init_path> <seq_path> <output_model_path>

	./test <models_list_path> <seq_path> <output_result_path>

	For example,
	under hw1
	./bin/train 100 ./model_init.txt ./data/train_seq_01.txt ./model_01.txt
	./bin/train 100 ./model_init.txt ./data/seq_model_02.txt ./model_02.txt
	./bin/train 100 ./model_init.txt ./data/seq_model_03.txt ./model_03.txt
 	./bin/train 100 ./model_init.txt ./data/seq_model_04.txt ./model_04.txt
 	./bin/train 100 ./model_init.txt ./data/seq_model_05.txt ./model_05.txt
	
	./bin/test ./modellist.txt ./data/test_seq.txt ./outputs/result.txt

========================
RESULT:
   The result is recorded in "result.txt" file after I trained my model 01 ~ 05 by "seq_model_01~05.txt", and tested with "test_seq.txt".
   * Correct Cases: 2355
   * Accuracy : 94.2%.

========================
OTHER NOTICE:
   1. Sequence Limitation:
         In this homework, the length of every training and testing sequences are fixed and same, so I record each input sequecse's length and choose the maxmimum (although every lengths are the same).
         Once the length sequences are not all the same, I just need to replace the value of "time" with my recorded length vector for every needed for loop. 

   2. Info. of "hmm.h":
         This header file, written in C language, is given by TA, it helps me need not to rewrite read/write functions, but I didn't use every funcions.
